# Morethansimplycode Framework

This is a "framework". This project contains classes to automatize some task. You got some persistence classes, data formatting, lambda functions or some GUI classes. These parts are modules, and they don't depends between them. 

## Formatting

**_Packages:_** <br />
*com.morethansimplycode.formatting* <br />
*com.morethansimplycode.formatting.formatters*

This package contains a class that wrap a StringBuilder, called StringFormatter, which adds a appendFormat method. appendFormat method is a C# like string format function.

#### How to format a String

**With normal objects:**

```
StringFormatter.format("Hi {0}", "John"); // Output -> "Hi John"
StringFormatter.format("Hi {0,10}", "John"); // Output -> "Hi       John"
StringFormatter.format("Hi {0,-10}", "John"); // Output -> "Hi John      "
```
> **Tip:** We can use 0..n args to format the string and {0}..{n} to positioning and format it in the string.

**Having a Person class which defines name, surname:**

We can implement the Formattable interface

```
public interface Formattable {

    public String toString(String format);

    public String toString(CustomFormatter formatter, String format);
}
```

And imagine our ToString() just replaces N with the name and SN with the surname so we can:

```
StringFormatter.format("Hi {0:N SN}", new Person("John", "Doe")); // Output -> "Hi John Doe"
StringFormatter.format("Hi, My name is: {0,10:N} and my surname is: {0,5:SN}", new Person("John", "Doe")); // Output -> "Hi, My name is:       John and my surname is:      Doe"
StringFormatter.format("{0: N N N N N SN N}", new Person("John", "Doe")); // Output -> "John John John John John Doe John"
```
> **Tip:** You can pass a CustomFormatter to choose how the arg will be formatted.

And remember StringFormatter.format() calls the toString() method of the args if they are not Formattable.


## Functions

**_Packages:_** <br />
*com.morethansimplycode.functions* <br />

This package have three classes: Checkout, Process and Processor.

### Classes:

**Checkout**

This class defines a check method, which asks for an Object to check and return a boolean indicating if is valid or not. In the future generics will be enabled for it.

**Process**

This class defines a process method, in order to process the given Object and returning a result. In the future generics will be enabled for it.

**Processor**

A class to check an Object and if its valid process it. It has a weight field, to use it to order in case of have a Collection or Array of Processor. In the future this will be comparable.

> **Tip:** If you have to parse, validate, or process some data in different ways depending on a condition, you can create an Array (or ArrayList if you want to dinamically add or remove) of Processors, difining the condition with a lambda as the checker, another lambda as the process and a weight in case of be valid to multiple conditions. In the future we will make a class that will automatically store Processors and receive Objects to process.
